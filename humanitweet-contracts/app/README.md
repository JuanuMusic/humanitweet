# Humanitweet Front End App
A React app (written in typescript) that interacts with the Humanitwet contracts.

Uses poh-resthttps://github.com/justinkalland/poh-rest to read proof of Humanity information off chain (which can be validated by contracts themselves, so security is guaranteed by the contracts themselves).
