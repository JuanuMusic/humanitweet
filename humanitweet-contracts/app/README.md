# Humanitweet Front End App
A React app (written in typescript) that interacts with the Humanitweet contracts.

Uses [poh-rest](https://github.com/justinkalland/poh-rest) to read Proof of Humanity information off-chain (which can be validated by contracts themselves, so security is guaranteed by the contracts themselves).
